      <div class="article-content" id="article-body" data-editable="true">
        <p class="lead">After the UK’s Online Safety Act went into effect this July, many people around the world have been up in arms about the purported censorship of the internet in this bill. Yesterday, the UK government issued a response to quell doubts and rumors about the effectiveness and necessity of the bill.</p>

        <p>The Act plans to eliminate and protect users from illegal content, such as fraud and terrorism. They also made new criminal offenses regarding the internet, such as encouraging or assisting in self-harm, threatening communications, and epilepsy trolling. However, they have neglected to include doxing and scamming as prohibited offenses, as they “aren’t considered dangerous to the online environment.” A UK government official states, “We really wanted to make sure kids were unable to access many of the internet’s dangerous and disturbing applications, such as Minecraft and Spotify. These apps truly endanger kids and risk exposure to harmful media and must be regulated by law.”</p>

        <p>UK officials also stated that this bill cuts down on other adolescent crime, such as underage drinking. “Before this bill, websites discussing drinking such as Alcoholics Anonymous were able to be accessed by anyone, even minors! Now, no one can access Alcoholics Anonymous without a picture of ID and a face scan, keeping our children out of trouble!” said one representative.</p>

        <p>To carry out the process of bringing this Act into fruition, the UK government has set up Ofcom to be the independent regulator of Online Safety. “Ofcom aims to protect the rights and safety of internet users, children and adults alike. They will do so by asking for a large amount of personal information to access many sites and applications. Obviously, this will help raise children’s awareness of the danger of sharing personal information on the internet,” a UK government official asserts.</p>

        <p>Ofcom will also be heavily enforcing these new regulations. Companies that don’t follow their guidelines will be fined up to 10% of their qualifying worldwide revenue. They will make most online applications require their restrictions, regardless of their origin. The Act has detailed plans to ensure harmful algorithms and foreign sites are able to be regulated to ensure the safety of their users. When asked about the detailed plans for protecting the data that users will now have to give up for their safety, a UK government official says, “Our main priority is protecting our users, no matter the site or application. We aren’t wasting our time on protecting data as of now, for the rights and safety of internet users come first.” Currently, personal information is kept safe on Dropbox, Microsoft’s analog of Google Drive.</p>

        <p>One major point of inquiry about the bill is how effective the new safety measures are against Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, which allow users to simulate their internet activity as coming from a different country. When asked for comment, the head of Ofcom responded “What the hell is a Vee-pin? [sic]”.</p>

        <p>Government officials were deeply touched by the feedback in response to the Online Safety Act, with the closing remarks of the afternoon being “No, we are not going to change anything, and if you think we should, you want to endanger children.”</p>
